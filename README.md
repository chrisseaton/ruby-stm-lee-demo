# Ruby STM Lee Demo

<img src="examples/testBoard.gif" width="50%">

This is a demo of using *Software Transactional Memory*, or *STM*, in Ruby to parallelise an algorithm for routing circuits called *Lee's Algorithm*. It shows some interesting points for discussion.

## Usage

```
% bundle exec ruby 1-draw-empty-board.rb inputs/testBoard.txt testBoard.svg
routes: 203

% bundle exec ruby 2-expensive-solution.rb inputs/testBoard.txt testBoard.svg
routes: 203
cost:   4168
depth:  5

% bundle exec ruby 3-sequential-lee.rb inputs/testBoard.txt testBoard.svg
routes: 203
cost:   3304
depth:  3

% bundle exec ruby 4-transactional-lee.rb inputs/testBoard.txt testBoard.svg testBoard-expansions
routes:      203
independent: 79
overlaps:    9
conflicts:   27
spare:       0
cost:        3307
depth:       3
```

You'll need to use a build of the `thread_tvar` branch from [this PR](https://github.com/ruby/ruby/pull/3652), with `instrument-atomically.patch` which applies cleanly on top of at least `66e45dc50c05d5030c8f9663bb159b8e2014d8ff`, in order to run the next two commands.

```
% bundle exec ruby 5-sequential-tvar-lee.rb inputs/testBoard.txt testBoard.svg
routes:      203
cost:        3304
depth:       3

% bundle exec ruby 6-concurrent-tvar-lee.rb inputs/testBoard.txt testBoard.svg
routes:      203
committed:   203
aborted:     7
cost:        3308
depth:       3
```

To run with ractors, you'll need to merge `thread_tvar` with at least `a99f52d5113a601b6d18bd671dfee24266689ffe` and still apply `instrument-atomically.patch`.

```
% N=2 bundle exec ruby 7-ractor-tvar-lee.rb inputs/testBoard.txt testBoard.svg
<internal:ractor>:38: warning: Ractor is experimental, and the behavior may change in future versions of Ruby! Also there are many implementation issues.
routes:      203
committed:   203
aborted:     61
cost:        3299
depth:       3
```

## Rendering

The SVGs produced aren't very efficient I'm afraid. You may be better off converting them to PNG.

```
% qlmanage -t -s 1000 -o testBoard-expansions testBoard-expansions/*.svg
```

You can also make an animated GIF.

```
% convert -transparent white -dispose previous -scale 250 -delay 10 -loop 1 testBoard-expansions/*.png testBoard.gif
```

## Inputs

#### `minimal.txt`

Simple enough to reason about manually. Two crossing routes. Note how the algorithm does not find the lowest-cost solution!

<img src="examples/minimal.svg" width="50%">

```
routes:      2
independent: 0
overlaps:    0
conflicts:   1
spare:       1
cost:        24
depth:       2
```

#### `testBoard.txt`

A small but realistic board.

<img src="examples/testBoard.svg" width="50%">

```
routes:      203
independent: 79
overlaps:    9
conflicts:   27
spare:       0
cost:        3307
depth:       3
```

#### `memboard.txt`

A memory module, so many shorter routes.

<img src="examples/memboard.svg" width="50%">

```
routes:      3101
independent: 1459
overlaps:    41
conflicts:   100
spare:       1
cost:        162917
depth:       3
```

#### `mainboard.txt`

A processor module, so more longer routes.

<img src="examples/mainboard.svg" width="50%">

```
routes:      1506
independent: 630
overlaps:    34
conflicts:   177
spare:       1
cost:        174128
depth:       3
```

#### `sparselong.txt`

Very long routes, which will likely conflict.

<img src="examples/sparselong.svg" width="50%">

```
routes:      29
independent: 0
overlaps:    0
conflicts:   28
spare:       1
cost:        16849
depth:       1
```

#### `sparseshort.txt`

Very short routes, which will likely not conflict.

<img src="examples/sparseshort.svg" width="50%">

```
routes:      841
independent: 419
overlaps:    1
conflicts:   1
spare:       0
cost:        9251
depth:       1
```

## Example transactions

Two clearly independent routes that can be solved completely in parallel.

<img src="examples/clearly-independent.svg" width="50%">

Two routes that overlap in what they read, but not what they write, so can be solved in parallel.

<img src="examples/overlaps.svg" width="50%">

A massive conflict, that could never be solved in parallel.

<img src="examples/massive-conflict.svg" width="50%">

A surprisingly large read-set for a small route, showing how unpredictable the area required is.

## Compatibility

Works on at least:

* MRI 2.7.2
* MRI `66e45dc50c05d5030c8f9663bb159b8e2014d8ff` + patch
* JRuby 9.2.13.0
* TruffleRuby 20.2.0

## Performance

We don't think there's much point looking at the performance of `TVar` in MRI yet - it's experimental. But it's interesting to compare Ruby implementations on the sequential solver. We can see how JRuby is 2x faster, and TruffleRuby is an order of magnitude faster.

```
% bundle exec ruby -v bench/sequential.rb
```
